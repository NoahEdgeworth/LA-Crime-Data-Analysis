# LA-Crime-Data-Analysis

** STILL IN PROGRESS**

I found a dataset on LA Crime Data from 2020-mid 2024 and thought it would be a interesting set of data to analyze. It is no secret that LA is one of the most crime filled cities in the US, and so I wanted to see what type of crime happens in the area. 

We will go through the process of cleaning and summarizing the data in not only Pandas, but tableau as well.
